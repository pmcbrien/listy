// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

$blueprint-grid-columns: 33;
$blueprint-container-size: 654px;
$blueprint-grid-margin: 6px;
// column width = 14
$prepend-columns: 1;
$content-columns: $blueprint-grid-columns - ($prepend-columns * 2);


// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set $blueprint-grid-width to a fixed value and unset $blueprint-container-size -- it will be calculated for you.
$blueprint-grid-width: ($blueprint-container-size + $blueprint-grid-margin) / $blueprint-grid-columns - $blueprint-grid-margin;
